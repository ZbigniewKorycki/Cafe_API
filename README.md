<h1>Cafe API</h1>

The Cafe API is a Flask-based RESTful API that allows users to manage and retrieve information about cafes. Users can perform various operations, such as adding new cafes, updating cafe prices, deleting cafes, and searching for cafes by location. The API also provides endpoints to retrieve random cafes and a list of all cafes.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 66.
